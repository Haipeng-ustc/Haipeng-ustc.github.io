Seismic Waveforn Inversion Toolbox-1.0, available from: [https://github.com/Haipeng-ustc/SWIT-1.0](https://github.com/Haipeng-ustc/SWIT-1.0).

* SWIT-1.0 is an FWI platform written in Fortran (wavefield modeling) and Python (nonlinear inversion & data preprocessing). SWIT-1.0 currently supports 2D inversion based on acoustic wave equation. More features are coming soon.
