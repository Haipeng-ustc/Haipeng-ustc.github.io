Seismic Waveforn Inversion Toolbox-1.0, available from: [https://github.com/Haipeng-ustc/SWIT-1.0](https://github.com/Haipeng-ustc/SWIT-1.0).



* SWIT-1.0 is an FWI platform written in Fortran (wavefield modeling) and Python (nonlinear inversion & data preprocessing). SWIT-1.0 currently supports 2D inversion based on acoustic wave equation, while more features are coming soon. 
* We have conducted several successful field-data applications. See our IMAGE'21 abstract: Li, H., Li, J., Liu, B., & Huang, X. (2021). Application of full-waveform tomography on deep seismic profiling data set for tectonic fault characterization. [Link](https://doi.org/10.1190/segam2021-3583190.1)
