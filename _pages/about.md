<!-- I obtained my M.S. degree in geophysics from the University of Science and Technology of China. Before that, I did my B.S. degree in geophysics at the China University of Petroleum (East China) and the University of Tulsa.

Hi, I'm Haipeng Li, a Ph.D. student in geophysics at Stanford University. My research interests include seismic waveform modeling, imaging, and inversion, and I have developed my expertise in the following directions:

- **Seismic Wavefield Modeling** 
  - Spectral Element Method (SEM)
  - Finite Element Method (FEM)
  - Theory of Absorbing Boundary Conditions (ABC)
- **Seismic Waveform Imaging & Inversion**
  -  Reverse Time Migration (RTM)
  -  Full Waveform Inversion (FWI)
  -  Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT)

At present, I'm exploiting *Machine Learning techniques* in seismic wave simulation. Also, I focus on investigating the *Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS)* to resolve real-life problems including hydrocarbon exploration, urban environment monitoring, and hazard mitigation. I'm looking for cooperation with those who share the similar research interests.
