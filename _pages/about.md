<!-- I obtained my M.S. degree in geophysics from the University of Science and Technology of China. Before that, I did my B.S. degree in geophysics at the China University of Petroleum (East China) and the University of Tulsa.

Hi, I'm Haipeng Li, a Ph.D. student in geophysics at [SEP](https://sep.sites.stanford.edu/), [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). My research interests include [seismic wavefield modeling](https://www.imagex.ltd/research/research-1/), [active/passive imaging](https://www.imagex.ltd/research/research-2/), and [full-waveform inversion](https://www.imagex.ltd/research/research-3/). I have developed my expertise in the following directions:

- **Seismic Wavefield Modeling** 
  - Spectral Element Method
  - Finite Element Method
  - Theory of Absorbing Boundary Conditions
- **Seismic Waveform Imaging & Inversion**
  -  Reverse Time Migration
  -  Full Waveform Inversion
  -  Ambient Noise Tomography

At present, I focus on investigating the *Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS)* to resolve real-life problems including hydrocarbon exploration, urban environment monitoring, and hazard mitigation. Also, I'm exploiting *Machine Learning techniques* in seismic wave simulation. I'm looking for cooperation with those who share the similar research interests.
