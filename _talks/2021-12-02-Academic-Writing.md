## Academic Paper Writing Tips
1. 确定论文题目；
2. 构思论文结构：列好论文的提纲和要写的内容；
3. 开始论文写作：先写Theory, Numerical tests，Examples和Discussion 部分，用质量普通的图片结果辅助写作，便于对图像所示内容的讨论和解释；
4. 增加论文内容：写Introduction和Abstract部分，同时根据Introduction的写作逻辑修改并调节正文内容的顺序；
5. 完善论文内容：添加论文引用，并从头开始修改每句话的语法和上下句的逻辑，增加连接词，副词，动词并进行同义词替换；
6. 精炼核心内容：精炼Abstract，并精炼每一个段落，增加段落的核心句和总结句；
7. 修改图片表格：修图，修表格以提高图片表格质量，达到发表的要求，同时修改对图片的引用标号，并增加对图片或表格细节的描述；
8. 确定论文初稿：对题目、Abstract再次敲定，对全文整体微调逻辑和润色，用Grammarly过一遍语法，确保语法无误。
9. 再次核对检查：检查引图标号，参考文献引用，参考文献列表是否完整，排列顺序是否正确，参考文献格式是否正确；
10. 正确格式排版：按照想投稿的期刊正确排版格式，图片、表格的title单独列出来，图片放到最后，附录材料整理完善等；
11. Cu-authors提建议：Revise paper draft accordingly again and again…
12. 在平时的科研中注意阶段性的总结和积累，有助于写introduction和添加引文。
